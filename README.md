# Dual-cancer-detector
This project uses two separate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models built with TensorFlow to detect brain tumors from MRI scans and lung cancer from chest X-ray images. It features a simple command-line interface for real-time predictions and demonstrates medical image classification with custom-trained deep learning models.
